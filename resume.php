        <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
        <div class="column_4">
            <p>I love learning and I have the ability to
                learn fast. For example, I prepared myself
                to take the pesticide applicator state exam
                in couple of weeks and passed it with high
                note by the first approach. Similarly, I got
                ready and passed the state exam for the
                insurance agent license.</p>
            <p>I have a great process improvement skills.
                While working on wiring machine,
                I implemented my solutions to the process
                that resulted in decrease of defected parts
                of about 20% to near 0 level.</p>
            <p>I have a good problem-solving skills and I
                know how to use resources. I had successfully
                established decent living conditions for
                my family in different countries.</p>
            <p>I value family and invest time in it. As a
                result, I built my family strong in faith.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column_5">
            <p>I'm determined to achieve my goals. I
                have the ability to adjust and be creative
                while finding solutions to the problems. For
                example, I earned my Web Design degree in
                five years while providing for my family,
                serving as a bishop, and helping my wife
                raising our children.</p>
            <p>I'm a hard worker and I'm willing to step up
                to do the job. For example, as a member of
                editorial board for magazine project in ENG
                450 class, I designed and developed the
                web site to display content of our magazine
                that boosted its quality beyond course's
                expectations.</p>
            <p>I have a strong leadership skills and positive
                attitude that motivates and incentives
                people I work with. Under my leadership,
                branch of 65 members doubled attendance
                and fulfilled all other requirements to
                become a ward.</p>
